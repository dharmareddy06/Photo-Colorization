# 🎨 Photo Colorization

This project uses deep learning to automatically convert **black-and-white** (grayscale) images into **fully colored** images. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or pretrained colorization models to predict realistic colors based on learned patterns from millions of images.

> ✨ With just a grayscale image as input, the model generates a vibrant, colorized version — restoring life to old photos, historical images, or artistic monochrome shots.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Black & White to Color Image Converter** is an AI-based image processing project that brings color to monochrome images. It uses machine learning (typically CNN or autoencoders) to analyze textures, shapes, and context within grayscale images and predict visually accurate color values.

Perfect for:

- Restoring old family photographs  
- Colorizing historical images  
- Enhancing black-and-white artwork  
- Computer vision research  
- Photo editing apps
